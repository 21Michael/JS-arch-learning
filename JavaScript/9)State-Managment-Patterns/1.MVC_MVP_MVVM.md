# MVC / MVP / MVVM:

1) **MVC (oneway-directional):**  

   1) **<ins>MVC design good as separation of each layer, as view, model, controller:</ins>**   
      - **Model:** manages the behavior and data of the application domain (business logic). 
        The model is **<ins> independent of the view </ins>**; meaning, it is not concerned 
        with the user interface and how the information is displayed on the user side;
      - **View:** represents the display of the model in the UI. The view, **<ins> is an observer 
        of the model. </ins>** Whenever the model gets modified (data is updated) it notifies 
        its observer (the view) which then reacts accordingly;
      - **Controller:** takes user input, manipulates the model and causes the view to update. **<ins> 
        The controller is the connection between the model and the view. </ins>** The two do not 
        interact with each other directly. The controller takes input from the user such as a 
        click or keypress which updates the view side and then updates the model accordingly. 
        It can sometimes update the view directly as well.;

        - JS implementation:
            ```js
                class EmployeeModel { 
                    constructor(name, designation, id){
                        this.name = name;
                        this.designation = designation;
                        this.id = id;
                    }
                    
                    getDesignation()  
                    { 
                        return this.designation
                    } 
                    getID(){

                    } 
                }

                var controller = new EmployeeController();
                view.registerWith(controller);
                
                console.log("Hiring a new employee Rachel");

       - **Frameworks implementation (two-way directional):** AngularJS, Ember, Backbone, Meteor, React... :  
            React:
            ```js
               const MVCComponent = () => {
                const [model, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialModel);
            
                const handleEvent = () => {
                    dispatch(action);
                };
            
                return 
                <>
                    <View1 model={model} handleEvent={handleEvent} />;
                    <View2 model={model} handleEvent={handleEvent} />; 
                </>
               }; 
            ```

        ### **!!! Bad Point in client MVC (two-way directional): !!!**  
        In server Side, MVC is good,but in Client side most of the JS frameworks **<ins> provide data 
        binding support which let the view can talk with model directly (two-way data binding) it 
        shoudn’t be!!! </ins>**. Many times it become hard to debug something as there are scope for 
        a property being changed by many ways.

        ### **Solution:**  
        Facebook faces the problem while developing chat system, view1 manipulates model1 and model1 
        updates the view2 like their system has circular dependency thats why they came up with 
        solution **<ins> flux </ins>**.

2) **MVP (Model-View-Presenter):**  
    It is derived from the MVC pattern, which focuses on the user interface. MVP is focused 
    on improving the presentation logic.  

    ![link](https://cf.ppt-online.org/files1/slide/u/ukhidLRnZzH4b8DFpfSerBq6UOEGNy5cMClwQxPXjm/slide-4.jpg)

    It consists of three components:  
      - **Model:** provides the data that the application requires, and we want to display in 
      the view.
      - **View:** to display the data from the model, it passes the user actions/commands to
      the presenter to act upon that data.
      - **Presenter:** acts as the middle man between the model and the view. Retrieves data 
      from the model manipulates it, and returns it to view for display. It also reacts to 
      the user’s interaction with the view.
    
**2.1) Client-side:**

  - JS implementation:
    ```js
        class Model {
            constructor(text) {
                this.text = text;
            }
            setText(text) {
                this.text = text;
            }
            getText() {
                return this.text;
            }
        }
        
        class View {
            constructor() {
                this.presenter = null;
            }
        
            registerWith(presenter) {
                this.presenter = presenter;
            }
        
            displayError() {
                console.log("Text is not in upper case");
            }
        
            displayMessage(text) {
                console.log("The text is: " + text);
            }
        
            changeText(text) {
                this.presenter.changeText(text);
            }
        }
        
        class Presenter {
            constructor(view) {
                this.view = view;
                this.model = null;
            }
        
            setModel(model) {
                this.model= model;
            }
        
            getView() {
                return this.view;
            }
        
            changeText(text) {
                if(text !== text.toUpperCase()) { 
                    this.view.displayError();
                } else {
                    this.model.setText(text); 
                    this.view.displayMessage(this.model.getText());
                }
            }
        }
        
        var model   = new Model("Hello world!")
        var view = new View()
        var presenter = new Presenter(view)
        
        presenter.setModel(model)
        
        view.registerWith(presenter)
        
        presenter.getView().changeText("unagi")
        presenter.getView().changeText("UNAGI")
    ```

  - **Frameworks implementation:** Apache Struts, knockoutJS...
    ```js
    
    ```

**Difference between MVP and MVC:**

![link](https://i.stack.imgur.com/A7cSy.jpg)

| MVC (Model View Controller)                  | MVP (Model View Presenter                       |
|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| UI(View) and data-access mechanism(Model) are tightly coupled. | The View is loosely coupled to the Model.                              |
| Controller and View layer falls in the same activity/fragment|Communication between View-Presenter and Presenter-Model happens via an interface.|
| User inputs are handled by Controller which instructs the model for further operations.|User inputs are handled by View which instructs the presenter to call appropriate functions.|
| The many-to-one relationship exists between Controller and View as one Controller can select different View based upon required operations.|The one-to-one relationship exists between Presenter and View as one Presenter class manages one View at a time.|
| The Controller is the overall in charge as it creates the appropriate View and interacts with the Model according to the user’s request.|The View is the overall in charge in this schema as View call methods of Presenter which further directs Model.|
| Limited support to Unit Testing |	Unit Testing is highly supported.|

**3) MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**  
It is based on the MVC and MVP patterns discussed in the previous lessons. It is used to 
further separate the working of the user interface from the business logic in the application.

![link](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQnVqV4cje4Z3z1aP02PDSKY3UWy3lDuDs8Kw&usqp=CAU)

It consists of three components:  
  - **Model:** As in the MVC and MVP patterns, the model stores all the data and information 
    required by the application. As you know, the model does not interfere with how this 
    data will be manipulated or displayed.
  - **View:** The view displays the information on the interface; it can also accept user input 
    hence contains behavior. In the MVVM pattern, the views aren’t passive. Passive views are 
    manipulated by the controller or presenter; they are responsible for displaying the 
    information without having any knowledge of the model. However, in MVVM, views are active.
    They contain data-bindings, behavior, and events that require the knowledge of model and 
    viewmodel. The view handles its events; it doesn’t depend on the viewmodel entirely; 
    however, it does not maintain its state, for that it syncs up with the viewmodel.

  - **ViewModel:** Similar to the controller in the MVC, the ViewModel acts as the connection
    between the model and the view. It converts information from the model format into the
    view format for display. For example, the model might have a date stored in Unix format,
    whereas the view might display it in another format. Here the ViewModel will help in 
    converting the information. It also updates the model when a user action on the view 
    occurs; hence, it is used to pass commands from view to the model. It is also used to 
    maintain the view’s state and trigger events on it.
    
**3.1) Client-side:**

  - JS implementation:
```js
//MODEL
class Model{
	constructor(){
		this.model  = {name : "Stuart"};
		this.observers = [];
	}
	subscribe(observer){
		this.observers.push(observer);
	}
	notifyObservers(attrName, newVal){
		for(var i = 0; i < this.observers.length; i++){
			this.observers[i](attrName, newVal);
		}
	}
	getCurrentName(nameKey){
		console.log(this.model[nameKey]);
		return this.model[nameKey];
	}
	
	setNameValue(nameKey, value){
		this.model[nameKey] = value;
		this.notifyObservers(nameKey, value);
	}
}

//VIEWMODEL  
class ViewModel{
	constructor(model){
		this.bind = function(viewElement, modelElement) {
      viewElement.value = model.getCurrentName(modelElement);
			model.subscribe(function(attrName, newValue) {
				document.getElementsByName(attrName).forEach(function(elem){
					elem.value = newValue.toUpperCase();
				});
			});
			viewElement.addEventListener('input', function(){
				model.setNameValue(viewElement.name, viewElement.value);
		});
	  }
	}
}

//VIEW
var nameInput = document.getElementById('name');
var nameCopy = document.getElementById('nameCopy');

var model = new Model()
var viewModel = new ViewModel(model);

viewModel.bind(nameInput, 'name');
viewModel.bind(nameCopy, 'name');
```
